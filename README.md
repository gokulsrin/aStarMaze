### Project Description

To whomever reads this doc, 

Hello. The following project was created by me, Gokul Srinivasan, as a teaching tool for the way the A* search algorithm functions. You may find yourself needing to install graphics.py, but that should be it. To use the program simply run it, select two distinct points, and click a few times and you will see the pathfinding algorithm visualized. I hope you find this useful.
